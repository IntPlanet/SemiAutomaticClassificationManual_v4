"Written by `Luca Congedo "
"<http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luca_Congedo>`_, the **Semi-Automatic "
"Classification Plugin** (SCP) is a free open source plugin for `QGIS "
"<http://www.qgis.org>`_ that allows for the **semi-automatic "
"classification** (also supervised classification) of remote sensing images. "
"Also, it provides several tools for the pre processing of images, the post "
"processing of classifications, and the raster calculation."

"SCP allows for the rapid creation of **ROIs** (training areas), through "
"**region growing** algorithm, which are stored in a shapefile. The **scatter"
" plot** or ROIs is available. Spectral signatures of training areas are "
"calculated automatically, and can be displayed in a **spectral signature "
"plot** along with the values thereof. Spectral distances among signatures "
"(e.g. Jeffries Matusita distance, or spectral angle) can be calculated for "
"assessing **spectral separability**. Spectral signatures can be exported and"
" imported from external sources. Also, a tool allows for the selection and "
"**download of spectral signatures** from the `USGS Spectral Library "
"<http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html>`_ ."

"SCP implements a tool for **searching and downloading Landsat and Sentinel**"
" images. The following tools are available for the **pre processing** of "
"images: **automatic Landsat conversion to surface reflectance**, "
"**clipping** multiple rasters, and **splitting** multi-band rasters."

#: ../../index.rst:19
msgid ""
"The **classification algorithms** available are: Minimum Distance, Maximum "
"Likelihood, Spectral Angle Mapping. SCP allows for interactive **preview of "
"classification**."

#: ../../index.rst:21
msgid ""
"The **post processing** tools include: **accuracy assessment**, land cover "
"change, classification report, classification to vector, reclassification of"
" raster values. Also, a band calc tool allows for the **raster calculation**"
" using `NumPy functions "
"<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.math.html>`_ ."
