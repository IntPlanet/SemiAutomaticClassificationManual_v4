"All Landsat 1,2, and 3 MSS and Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 images downloaded from"
" http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ and processed with the Level 1 Product "
"Generation System (LPGS) can be converted to reflectance automatically by "
"the SCP; products generated by the LPGS have a MTL file included that is "
"required for the conversion. Since version 3.1.1 the SCP can also convert "
"images from the `Global Land Cover Facility <http://glcfapp.glcf.umd.edu/>`_"
" (images available for free from ftp://ftp.glcf.umd.edu/glcf/Landsat/). In "
"particular, images having an old format of the MTL file (or a .met file) can"
" be processed through the automatic conversion to reflectance and the DOS "
"correction. However, some images do not have the required information and "
"cannot be processed. Also, notice that some images available from the Global"
" Land Cover Facility are already converted to reflectance. For this process,"
" image bands must be renamed in order to remove the final 0 if present (e.g."
" rename B10 to B1)."

"Can I apply the Landsat conversion and DOS correction to clipped bands?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ.rst:61
msgid ""
"Yes, you can clip the images before the conversion to reflectance and then "
"copy the MTL file (contained in the Landsat dataset) inside the directory "
"with the clipped bands. If you want to apply the DOS correction (which is an"
" image based technique) you should convert the original Landsat bands (the "
"entire image) and then clip the conversion output (i.e. bands converted to "
"reflectance)."

#: ../../FAQ.rst:69
msgid ""
"If you want to apply the DOS correction to an entire Landsat band which has "
"NoData values (the black border with value = 0) then you have to check the "
"checkbox ``Use NoData value`` and set the value to 0. This is because DOS is"
" an image based technique, and NoData values must be excluded from the "
"calculation."
