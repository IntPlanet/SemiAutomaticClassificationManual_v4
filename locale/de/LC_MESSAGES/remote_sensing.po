"There are several definitions of **GIS** (Geographic Information Systems), "

"the use of geographic information (data have spatial coordinates). In "
"particular, GIS allow for the view, query, calculation and analysis of "
"spatial data, which are mainly distinguished in raster or vector data "
"structures. Vector is made of objects that can be points, lines or polygons,"
" and each object can have one ore more attribute values; a raster is a grid "
"(or image) where each cell has an attribute value (Fisher and Unwin, 2005). "
"Several GIS applications use raster images that are derived from remote "
